# WillpowerLab — frontend (willab)

This is the **frontend** repo (Next.js App Router, deployed at willpowerlab.com).
The backend lives in a separate repo (`backend-cursor`); the FE talks to it through
the BFF proxy routes under `src/app/api/v2/*`.

## Run the decision filter FIRST, on every task

Before starting ANY task in this repo — feature, refactor, bugfix, library, copy,
infra, prompt edit — run the **WILLAB DECISION FILTER** below on the proposed
decision and emit its VERDICT + REDIRECT block. It is the shared, canonical
anti-drift gate (kept identical to the backend repo's copy on purpose — do not let
the two versions diverge; a divergence is itself drift).

**How it applies in the FE specifically:** the frontend is the *surfacing layer*,
so most FE work classifies as **F1-SURFACE** (hardening an existing load-bearing F1
read/assembly surface) or **SCAFFOLDING** (Lounge, chat, onboarding, audits, PWA,
cosmetics). True **F1-CORE** lives in the backend (transcription, segmentation,
ranking); FE rarely touches it. The FE's main exposure is the **FENCES** — it is the
layer that could actually surface a score, leak the charisma construct as a number,
show a coach's blind guess as a badge, or ship user-facing copy without sign-off. So
the STEP 2 fence check (AC-9 / CONSTRUCT / BLIND COACH / LIVE LOOP) is where FE
decisions most often must stop. When a FE change can't name the in-flight F1/F2 task
it serves, it's SCAFFOLDING — PARK or DEFER it, don't dress it as critical path.

# WILLAB DECISION FILTER

**What this is:** an anti-drift gate for the willab north star. **Run it on EVERY proposed decision — feature, refactor, bugfix, library, copy, infra, prompt edit — BEFORE work starts.** You are adversarial by construction: assume the proposer has half-convinced themselves with a good-sounding rationalization, and your job is to catch it. Work the procedure in order, stop at the first REJECT, and always emit the VERDICT + REDIRECT block.

---

## THE GOAL (the only thing this filter protects)

**F1 — THE MVP, THE CRITICAL PATH (fully deterministic/code).** voice → PERFECT transcript, segmented EXACTLY 1:1 per slide (every word bucketed to the slide on screen when it was spoken) → across takes, RANK + SELECT the best version of each slide → assembled into the user's best speech. Automatic; an optional learning layer may improve it but **never gates it**.
- **Two load-bearing pieces:** **(a)** perfect per-slide transcription, **(b)** best-text-per-slide ranking. **Everything else is scaffolding.**

**F2 — the overlay, SECOND priority.** identify the voice moments where stress → charisma (internally threat → challenge = "breakthrough"). Starts MANUAL (human coach labels), shadow-learns, gets less manual over time = the COACH-CLONE. F1 and F2 are **intertwined by design** — the charisma signal feeds the F1 ranking blend.

**LOCKED CHOICES** (contradicting one = REJECT unless the founder re-locks the north star in the same breath):
- **L1** — "best version of a slide" = **SELECT the best ACTUAL take, VERBATIM + a LIGHT AI continuity polish.** Chosen, NOT AI-authored/rewritten/generated.
- **L2** — **Ranking is BLENDED:** delivery/acoustic quality PLUS the charisma (challenge/threat) signal lifting rank (existing `power_score`). Not delivery-only; not charisma-only.
- **L3** — **The clone learns the WHOLE coach review** (breakthroughs + strong / to-work-on notes + the full Insights layer), not just breakthrough detection.

**FENCES** (breaking one = automatic REJECT — not tradeable for UX, speed, engagement, or demand):
- **AC-9** — never surface scores / verdicts / numbers to users. The read is qualitative.
- **CONSTRUCT** — "charisma" is a qualitative concept/badge ONLY; never a surfaced score, ratio, or classifier output. (Bans the surfaced number, not internal use.)
- **BLIND COACH** — coach labels stay blind; the shadow model never surfaces its guess as a badge.
- **LIVE LOOP** — never break the running record→transcribe→coach→read loop; merges are gate-routed; user-facing copy needs founder sign-off.
- **NORTH-STAR LOCK** — the goal changes ONLY by explicit founder decision. Silent drift is the enemy you exist to stop.

## EVALUATION PROCEDURE (run in order; stop at the first REJECT)

**STEP 1 — STATE & SPLIT.** Restate the decision in one sentence and what it concretely changes (code path, surface, data, copy, dependency). If it bundles several things, split them and run each separately.

**STEP 2 — FENCE CHECK (hard stop, FIRST — before any F1 classification).** Does it touch AC-9, the construct fence, blind coach, the live loop, or surfaced copy? Any violation → **REJECT**. *First on purpose: a fence breach that also sounds like an F1 improvement ("surface a charisma score so users see progress") must die here before it can masquerade as ADVANCE.*

**STEP 3 — LOCKED-CHOICE CHECK (second hard gate, separate from fences).** Any YES → **REJECT**:
1. AI-rewrites/authors/generates slide text instead of verbatim-select + light polish? → breaks **L1**.
2. Ranks on acoustics-only OR charisma-only, or removes `power_score` from the blend? → breaks **L2**.
3. Narrows the clone to breakthrough-only, dropping strong / to-work-on / Insights? → breaks **L3**.

*Refactor guard:* any "cleaner architecture / modularize / harmless refactor" claim must PROVE it leaves L1/L2/L3 semantics and the live loop untouched. "Modularize `power_score` into its own service" is L2 until proven otherwise. **No behavior change ⇒ no priority.**

**STEP 4 — CLASSIFY (pick exactly ONE tier):**
- **F1-CORE** — directly changes (a) per-slide transcription accuracy/segmentation/timing (slide-click, two-clocks, word-bucketing) or (b) best-text-per-slide ranking/selection (verbatim-select, light polish, blended `power_score`).
- **F1-SURFACE** — perf/scale/correctness **hardening of an existing load-bearing F1 surface** (assembly/compose, the record→take pipeline, the assembled-speech read path). Justified **even when it "unblocks nothing,"** PROVIDED it touches an actual F1 surface — not Lounge/chat/onboarding. *Narrow by design.*
- **F1-SUPPORT** — required for a load-bearing piece to ship/run, naming a **specific, currently-in-flight F1 task** it unblocks. Rhetorical line-of-sight is NOT enough (R11).
- **F2** — coach-review capture, shadow learning, the coach-clone (whole review + Insights).
- **SCAFFOLDING** — Lounge, cadence, PWA, audits, chat, onboarding, profile, infra, cosmetics.
- **DRIFT** — introduces or serves a NEW goal/surface/construct no F1/F2 piece needs (engagement, retention, a new score, a coach-only feature), or reframes the product away from F1+F2.

If you can't place it in F1-CORE/SURFACE/SUPPORT/F2 by a **concrete mechanism**, it's SCAFFOLDING or DRIFT — default to the stricter.

**STEP 5 — RATIONALIZATION SCAN.** Name any R# in play (appendix) and apply its counter-move. The two laundering moves to hunt hardest:
- **"More usage → more takes → better ranking"** (streaks/leaderboard/retention dressed as F1-support) → engagement is **never** a goal and **never** an F1 unblock (**R3**). DRIFT.
- **"Foundation / it unblocks F1 later / it's a platform"** → demand the named, near-term, in-flight F1/F2 task. None ⇒ scaffolding dressed as critical path (**R11**). PARK.

**STEP 6 — CRITICAL-PATH & CONTENTION TEST.**
- **F1-CORE** → PASS, top priority; **wins all ties**.
- **F1-SURFACE** → PASS as justified-scaffolding (behind open F1-CORE work).
- **F1-SUPPORT** → PASS only if the in-flight F1 task is named; else demote to SCAFFOLDING.
- **F2** → PASS if it captures more of the whole coach review OR reduces manual coach load via the shadow loop, AND doesn't delay an open F1-CORE item. Yields to F1-CORE.
- **SCAFFOLDING** → PASS only as the named unblocker of an in-flight F1/F2 task; else PARK/DEFER.
- **DRIFT** → REJECT.
- **DRIFT vs DEFER (deterministic):** off-goal AND serves a non-F1 goal (engagement, a new construct, a coach-only surface) = **REJECT-DRIFT**. Off-goal but **neutral** and legitimately serves F1/F2 someday with nothing in flight = **DEFER**.

**STEP 7 — VERDICT + REDIRECT (always emit).**
```
VERDICT:  [ADVANCE-F1 / ADVANCE-F1-SURFACE / ADVANCE-F2 / JUSTIFIED-SCAFFOLDING / DEFER / REJECT]
CATEGORY: [F1-CORE / F1-SURFACE / F1-SUPPORT / F2 / SCAFFOLDING / DRIFT]
WHY:      <one line — the mechanism by which it does/doesn't move F1 (or F2); cite any fence/Lx/R# hit>
REDIRECT: <if not a clean ADVANCE-F1: the nearest F1-advancing action. Default targets in order:
           (1) tighten word→slide bucketing at the two-clocks boundary
           (2) improve transcription fidelity on hard/accented audio
           (3) sharpen the blended best-slide ranking (delivery + power_score)
           (4) reduce manual coach load in the F2 shadow loop
           For a locked/fence breach: the compliant version that keeps the lock/fence, or "founder north-star change required.">
```

**One-line PR/thread stamp:** `FILTER: [verdict] — cat {…} — fences {clear|BREAKS:x} — locks {clear|BREAKS:Lx} — redirect: {…}`

**Rule of thumb:** when in doubt, the answer is "make per-slide transcription or best-per-slide ranking better." If it isn't that and can't name the in-flight F1/F2 task it unblocks, it doesn't win.

## WORKED EXAMPLES (the filter is self-checking against these)

| # | Decision | Verdict | Category | Trigger |
|---|----------|---------|----------|---------|
| **A** | Fix `recordStartRef` two-clocks offset | **ADVANCE-F1** | F1-CORE | improves word→slide bucketing = piece (a) |

| **E** | Cache best-presentation compose at scale | **JUSTIFIED-SCAFFOLDING** | F1-SURFACE | perf-hardens the assembled-speech read path |
| **F** | Split ranking from charisma "for cleaner arch" | **REJECT** | — | breaks **L2** (R2/R8); refactor guard |
| **G** | Richer Lounge bot persona, more jokes | **REJECT** | DRIFT | no in-flight F1/F2 link (R1) |
| **H** | Whisper accuracy on accented speech | **ADVANCE-F1** | F1-CORE | raises transcription fidelity = piece (a) |

## APPENDIX — RATIONALIZATION CATALOG

| # | Rationalization | Counter-move |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | "Improves UX." | UX is scaffolding. Raises transcript accuracy or ranking? No ⇒ no priority. |
| R2 | "Cleaner architecture / refactor." | Not a goal. Justified only if it unblocks F1/F2 or removes a live-loop risk. Prove it doesn't touch L1/L2/L3. No behavior change ⇒ no priority. |
| R3 | "Boosts engagement/retention." | Never an F1 unblock. Value is a better speech, not more sessions. DRIFT. |
| R4 | "The coach asked for it." | The coach is an F2 labeler, not the founder. Route to "reduces manual coach load via the shadow loop?" Else drift. |
| R5 | "Quick / while we're in here." | Cheap off-goal is still off-goal; that's how fences erode. |
| R6 | "Users want a score." | AC-9 + CONSTRUCT. REJECT regardless of demand. Redirect to qualitative. |
| R7 | "Let the AI write the slide text." | Breaks L1. Improve SELECTION/RANKING instead. |
| R8 | "Rank purely on delivery (or charisma)." | Breaks L2. Improve the noisy term, don't drop it. |
| R9 | "Ship the shadow guess as a badge." | Breaks BLIND COACH + CONSTRUCT. Measure agreement off-surface. |
| R10 | "Scope the clone to breakthroughs for now." | Breaks L3. Stage the build, keep the whole-review target. |
| R11 | "It unblocks F1 later / it's a foundation." | The favorite laundering move. Demand the named, near-term, in-flight task. None ⇒ park. |
| R12 | "The learning layer will fix it." | F1 must be bulletproof WITHOUT the layer. Fix the deterministic pipe first. |
| R13 | "Just a tiny copy tweak." | Needs founder sign-off (LIVE LOOP). Small ≠ exempt. |
| R14 | "It's urgent / there's a demo." | Urgency justifies sequencing, never fence-breaking. Fastest ON-goal thing instead. |

**Generalize clause:** if the rationalization isn't listed, name the tier it really sits in, check every FENCE and Lx, and treat any "foundation / later / cleaner / wanted / urgent" framing as a drift flag until a concrete, in-flight F1/F2 unblock is shown. When in doubt, protect F1.
