# The Life Panel — implementation document

**Status:** plan, not built. Spec of record. Build prompts are this file's pair,
`docs/life-panel-fe-prompt.md`, and the backend's `PROMPT-BE-life-panel.md`.
**Date:** 2026-07-26
**Gate:** two-tier. The principles engine is public behind consent (L-6); prayer
and the founder-only surfaces stay on the allowlist. `LIFE_PANEL_ENABLED` kills
all of it.
**Scope:** absorb principles-app, timeline, and the daily/weekly governance
system into willpowerlab as gated trial features. Leave pompeiana standalone
(see §3.4).

```
VERDICT:  JUSTIFIED-SCAFFOLDING (founder-directed)
CATEGORY: SCAFFOLDING
WHY:      Moves neither F1 load-bearing piece (per-slide transcription,
          best-per-slide ranking) nor F2. It is a new surface serving a new
          goal, a personal life-governance system. It passes on founder
          direction plus hard isolation from the live loop. No fence hit:
          nothing here surfaces a score to a product user (AC-9), no coach
          label leaks, no product copy on an F1 surface, L1/L2/L3 untouched.
PRECEDENT: Journal/CMS (PR #254) — founder-directed scaffolding, fenced off
          the live loop by an isolation test. Same shape, same fence.
GUARD:    Isolation is the price of admission. Any part of this that needs to
          modify an F1 path (record → transcribe → coach → read) is rejected
          and rerouted. The single permitted contact point is the chat router
          (§5), and it is guarded by a byte-identical-response test.
REDIRECT: Standing F1 target if this stalls — tighten word→slide bucketing at
          the two-clocks boundary.

## 1. The architecture decision

### 1.1 Answer: one codebase, one deploy, one database

`mvp.willpowerlab.com` as an alias, not a copy.

| | Decision |
|---|---|
| Codebase | `backend-cursor` + `frontend-cursor`. No new repo, no fork. |
| Routes | BE `/v2/life/*` · FE `/panel/*` |
| Hostname | `willpowerlab.com/panel` is canonical. `mvp.willpowerlab.com` MAY be added as a second hostname pointing at the same deploy, whose only effect is that `/` lands on `/panel` instead of the product home. |
| Gate | Server-side allowlist on `user_id`. Not a role, not a CSS hide: the payload omits the features entirely. |
| Data | Same Supabase instance, `life_*` table namespace, RLS on every table, never joined to product tables. |

### 1.2 Why not a full copy at mvp.willpowerlab.com

Rejected. The premise of the whole design is that the chat is for everything: you
type a case into the same chat you already use, and the daily goal appears there
each morning. A second deploy forks the chat, the auth session, and the session
state. Within a month every F1 fix lands twice, by hand, and the divergence is
how the live loop actually breaks.

A subdomain also buys less isolation than it appears to. If both hostnames read
the same Supabase, and they must or you have two accounts, then a query bug leaks
the same data either way. The isolation that matters is at the table and RLS
layer, not the DNS layer.

### 1.3 Why not "just leave them as separate apps and link out"

That is today's state, and it is what the migration ends. It also leaves the
principles corpus sitting in an unauthenticated Firestore document keyed by a
12-character share code (§4.2).

### 1.4 The two-tier gate (revised by L-6)

| Surface | Gate |
|---|---|
| Principles tab, `#` engine, setup, strategy docs, timeline | consent. Public to any signed-in user who passed the consent screen |
| Prayer link, and anything founder-only | `LIFE_PANEL_ALLOWLIST`, comma-separated user ids, env var |
| All of the above | `LIFE_PANEL_ENABLED`, global kill switch, default OFF |

- **Not consented** → `/v2/life/*` returns 409 with a pointer to the Principles
  tab, except the consent and setup endpoints themselves. A `#` note is still
  stored (§6.2), not executed.
- **Not on the allowlist** → allowlisted entries are absent from the payload, and
  their endpoints 404, not 403. A 403 confirms the surface exists. Nothing to
  discover, no copy.
- **Flag off** → every `/v2/life/*` route 404s and the menu payload is unchanged
  from today.

### 1.5 Locked system rules (founder, 2026-07-26)

These five override anything below them. They are not tradeable for convenience
or capability.

- **L-1 — The system never drafts reflections.** Reflections are written by the
  founder and polished through the Ideal Text tool externally, then pasted in as
  structured input. This is a manual copy-paste, not an integration: the panel
  makes no call into the F1 ideal-text pipeline. The system may still propose the
  👾 category (from the fixed six) and the ⚜️ new principle one-liner, and may
  retrieve which existing principles bore on the case. It never authors the
  reflective prose.

- **L-2 (AMENDED 2026-07-26) — The system drafts the strategy docs; every change
  is gated.** Superseding the "pure comparative mirror" form locked earlier the
  same day. GPT generates the initial daily / weekly / monthly / quarterly /
  yearly / 5y / 10y / 20y documents from the user's own setup answers, and
  proposes updates to them as new input arrives. Nothing lands without an approve
  button, and every proposed change must display one of the user's own principles
  as its warrant.

  Two guards are mandatory consequences of this amendment, not optional extras:

  - **L-2a — Immutable core.** Section I (The Anchor) and the rank of the three
    bets are hand-edited only. Never proposed, never redrafted. Without this, the
    standard the system judges alignment against is a standard the system wrote,
    and the 20-year vision can drift through eight months of individually
    reasonable approvals.
  - **L-2b — Change budget.** At most one strategy-change proposal surfaced per
    day; the rest queue to the weekly review and arrive as a ranked batch of
    three. Unactioned proposals expire after two weeks rather than accumulating.
    Scarcity is what keeps "approve" meaningful; a daily stream of diffs becomes
    a rubber stamp within three weeks, and the rubber stamp is the drift.

- **L-3 — Principles: surface paradoxes, never resolve them.** When two
  principles pull opposite ways, both are shown and the founder weighs them. When
  a new principle appears to supersede an old one, the system asks "does this
  retire #12?" with full veto; on "no", both stay active.

- **L-4 — Zero nudges.** No pings, no notifications, no activity tracking, no
  silence detection, no character checks. Not typing means living, not failing.
  The system is dormant until opened.

- **L-5 — Application logging + 3-tier timeline.** Every time a principle is
  cited (in a case, a comparison flag, or a conflict pair) it is logged as an
  application, so load-bearing principles separate from decorative ones over
  months. The 60-year timeline renders at quarter / year / decade zoom tiers.

- **L-6 — Public feature, consented.** The Principles tab ships to all users, not
  the allowlist. Page 1 explains what principles and `#` are; page 2 is a consent
  screen and must be passed before any life data is written. Prayer stays
  coach-only for now. See §6.1 for what going public costs.

**What L-4 costs, stated once.** The system now catches only the drift you bring
to it. Losing focus and not opening the app is invisible to it by design. That is
the accepted trade.

---

## 2. Privacy fence — load-bearing, read before writing any code

The corpus is not neutral productivity data. It contains addiction, sexual
behaviour, confession-shaped religious material, named third parties (family,
ex-colleagues, a business partner, women by first name), and financial history.
It is being moved from a device-local store into a server-backed multi-tenant
product database.

Hard rules, all testable:

- **RLS on every `life_*` table in its creating migration.** Not a follow-up
  sweep. The July 2026 audit found 57 exposed public tables; this class of data
  must not be number 58.
- **`life_*` is never joined to a product table**, and never written into the
  SHARED master document. Amended 2026-07-26: principles / phrases / strategy MAY
  be injected into the per-user block of `master_doc_rag`, so untagged chat gets
  smarter for `#` users, the same mechanism the strong-sides library already uses.
- **Bound it exactly like the library does.** `services/master_doc_rag.py` caps
  the library at 20 entries and trims each excerpt, and RULE K states the answer
  is "NEVER a dump of the strong-sides library." That cap is not cosmetic: the
  Lounge prompt already ran over its attention ceiling once (PRs #81 to #89:
  rules moved out of the prompt into code, minus 22 lines of prompt, RULE-K
  hardening). Injecting 60 principles plus a seven-horizon strategy document into
  that prompt would re-open the exact failure they fixed.
  Therefore: retrieve top-N by relevance, hard cap, trim, never the whole corpus,
  and re-run `tests/evals/master_doc_probe.py` with the injection on. If the
  probe baseline drops, the injection shrinks. The injection yields, never the
  probe.
- **Injection happens at request time from the requesting user's own rows.**
  Nothing crosses users. The isolation test asserts no product-side module
  imports the life module and that the shared master body is never written to.
- **Third-party names.** The corpus names real people alongside claims about
  them. It stays private to one user forever: no sharing surface, no
  export-to-community, no "publish a principle" feature. If a principle is ever
  to be published, it is retyped by hand into the Journal, not exported from here.
- **LLM calls.** Routing sends this content to GPT-4o. Use an API path with no
  training retention, log the derivation output, never the raw note body, and
  never send a full corpus dump as context: retrieve the ~10 relevant principles,
  not all 60.
- **Own-data export and hard delete ship in Phase 1**, not "later". You must be
  able to get it out and wipe it.
- **Pompeiana scripture never leaves the device** (§3.4).

---

## 3. Data model

Nine kinds, one items table, plus the case rows and the strategy doc. Sized for
one user.

```
life_notes          raw capture, append-only, never edited, never deleted
  id · user_id · body · source ('chat'|'form'|'import') · created_at

life_cases          the Dalio reflection — five slots, one row
  id · user_id · case_at_hand · category (see 3.1) · principles_applied
  · reflections · occurred_on (nullable — some cases carry a date)
  · origin_note_id · created_at

life_items          everything else, discriminated by kind
  id · user_id · kind · title · body · status · order_key
  · horizon · due_label · due_at · bet_id · parent_id
  · origin_note_id · origin_case_id · created_at · updated_at

life_strategy       the weekly doc, versioned, never overwritten
  id · user_id · body · version · reviewed_on · created_at

life_days           one row per day — the daily card (§3.3)
life_weeks          one row per week — the weekly review (§3.3)

kind ∈ { principle, win, phrase, bet, goal, task, habit, distraction, event }
```

Note: the case fields live on `life_cases`, and the principle it produced is a
`life_items` row with `origin_case_id`. Splitting them (rather than the current
app's single row) is justified by the corpus: several cases produced two
principles ("Focus on saving your own life first" plus "Don't try to understand
it all"), and several carry two categories.

### 3.1 The mistake taxonomy — FIXED, six entries

Derived from the corpus. Not free-text, not emergent. GPT-4o must pick from this
list; it may propose a seventh only as a suggestion you approve.

| | Category | Corpus frequency |
|---|---|---|
| 👾 | Hubris | highest |
| 👾 | Blind spots | high |
| 👾 | Wishful thinking | high |
| 👾 | Too much pleasure | medium |
| 👾 | Frivolous decision making | low |
| 👾 | Perfectionist | low |

A case may carry more than one (the scooter/drift case carries Wishful thinking
plus Hubris). Store as an array, render as multiple 👾 lines.

### 3.2 Bets and the goal cascade

The weekly doc's Section II is the spine. Three bets, ranked, not equal:

```
bet   rank 1  🟢 The Life      family · faith · community
bet   rank 2  🔵 The Company   willab — the active bet
bet   rank 3  🟣 The Dream     research · 7T · horizon 2035
```

Goals hang off a bet with a horizon and a due label copied verbatim from your own
notation:

```
horizon  ∈ { now, month, quarter, year, five_year, ten_year }
due_label   free text as you write it — "[NOW]", "[Aug]", "[Dec]", "[Jul '27]", "2030", "2035"
due_at      parsed where unambiguous, nullable otherwise — the label is the source of truth
```

The rank is load-bearing: when the router proposes a task, it must be able to say
which bet it serves, and Bet 3 never outranks Bet 2 in a daily plan. That is your
own stated rule ("It does not drive daily execution, Bet 2 does"), encoded.

### 3.3 The daily card and the weekly review

`life_days`, one row per date, the template rendered as data:

```
morning_checks      jsonb  — the habit checkboxes that ran
one_thing           text   — 🎯 TODAY'S ONE THING
focus_blocks        jsonb  — [{text, box}] ×3
distraction_flagged text   — the pre-start check, nullable
evening_habits_ran  bool
evening_one_thing   bool
evening_distraction text
evening_line        text   — "am I becoming the man I described?"
```

`life_weeks`, Sunday review: habits that failed and why · goals that moved plus
next action · main distraction · one environmental change · the becoming
sentence.

The environmental-change field matters: Section IV pairs every distraction with a
design response, not with willpower. `kind='distraction'` items carry
`body` = the environmental response, and the weekly review appends one new one
per week.

### 3.4 Pompeiana — its own subdomain, shared login

`pompeiana.willpowerlab.com`, a separate app with its own deploy and its own
screens, signed in through willpowerlab auth. Not ported into the panel; linked
from the hamburger (coach-only for now).

Why it stays separate: zero-network by design, offline-first via service worker,
10 languages from local JSON, and the README states the scripture text is
deliberately NOT in the repo. The user pastes it from their own legally-held
Bible and it is stored locally only. Absorbing it breaks the rule the app was
built around and adds copyright exposure.

Auth must be optional, or the offline guarantee dies. This is the one hard
constraint the subdomain move introduces:

- Praying works fully signed-out and fully offline. Always. A login wall in front
  of a 54-day novena breaks it on day 12 in a basement with no signal.
- Sign-in unlocks cross-device continuity only. Sign-out degrades to today's
  behaviour, not to a locked door.
- Sync payload is `{startDate, currentDay, progress, intention}`, nine integers
  and a string. Scripture never leaves the device. Not synced, not backed up, not
  logged.
- SSO across `willpowerlab.com` → `pompeiana.willpowerlab.com`: cookie scoped to
  `.willpowerlab.com`, or a short-lived token handoff. Separate subdomain means
  separate service worker scope and a separate PWA install, which is correct and
  wanted.

The daily card's ☐ Pompeiana checkbox stays a local habit tick in `life_days`. It
does not read the prayer app's state. Deliberate: coupling stays at zero.

### 3.5 Smart phrases

`kind='phrase'`, with a collection tag ("2022-24", "2025", "2026") and free text.
Currently these live inside the `prayer.v1` localStorage blob in principles-app,
a single text field being used as a dump. The importer splits that blob on quote
boundaries into phrase rows; anything it can't split stays as one note so nothing
is lost.

The weekly doc's Section V ("The Principles Wall") is the same kind with
`collection='wall'`.

### 3.6 Timeline — ported, re-skinned

Unlike prayer, the timeline lives inside the app at `/panel/timeline` and adopts
the app's visual design. The canvas renderer and interaction model port from the
existing `index.html`; the styling does not. Three zoom tiers (quarter / year /
decade), 60-year horizon, goals as bands coloured by bet (🟢🔵🟣 already match the
existing `categoryColor` field).

---

## 4. Migration — the data-survival plan

This runs before anything else is built. Live data must survive and there is
currently no backup in an importable form.

### 4.1 Sources

| App | Where the data is | Export today |
|---|---|---|
| principles-app | localStorage `principles.v1` / `wins.v1` / `prayer.v1`, mirrored to Firestore collection `principles`, doc id = your sync code | none |
| timeline | localStorage `timeline.events.v1`, mirrored to Firestore project `timeline-aa2aa` | ✓ Export button |
| daily / weekly | the two documents pasted in this thread | manual |
| pompeiana | localStorage `pompeiana.v1`, device-only | none, stays put |

### 4.2 Exposure note

Both Firestore mirrors are unauthenticated. The 12-character sync code is the
credential: anyone holding it reads the entire corpus, every reflection quoted in
this thread. There is no rate limit and no audit trail. Migrating to willpowerlab
auth plus RLS closes this, and it is an independent reason to do the migration
beyond convenience.

### 4.3 Order of operations

1. Add an Export button to principles-app (~10 lines, standalone change to that
   repo, no willab code touched). Export on the device with the most data. This
   is step one because it is the only thing standing between you and an
   unrecoverable localStorage clear.
2. Export timeline with the existing button.
3. Transcribe the daily plus weekly docs into `life_strategy` v1 and the
   bet/goal/habit rows.
4. Build the importers against those three JSON files.
5. Only after the imports verify: point the old apps at the new API, or retire
   them.

### 4.4 What the importer must preserve

- `createdAt`. The corpus spans 2022 to 2026 and the dates carry meaning.
- The exact category strings, mapped to the six-entry taxonomy; anything unmapped
  goes to a review queue rather than being silently coerced.
- Multi-principle and multi-category cases (they exist, see §3.1).
- The Polish text verbatim. No translation, no normalisation, no "cleanup" pass.
  Several reflections are code-switched mid-paragraph and that is the record.
- The manual order of the principles list (drag-to-reorder state) → `order_key`.

---

## 5. Chat integration — the one live-surface contact point

The panel's capture surface is the existing chat. This is the only place the
trial features touch shipped code, so it gets the tightest guard.

```
POST /v2/chat/query
  ↓
  allowlist check  ──not listed──→  existing path, untouched, byte-identical
  ↓ listed
  life intent classifier (cheap, deterministic first, LLM second)
  ↓ no life intent
  existing path
  ↓ life intent
  /v2/life/* handler → response with a card + a link into /panel/<view>
```

**Guard:** a test that runs the full existing chat suite with a non-allowlisted
user and asserts responses are byte-identical to main. If that test is not green,
the branch does not merge. This is the same discipline as the Journal isolation
test.

Routing is by hashtag, not by classifier. You declare the intent; the system does
not guess. Deterministic, free, and never wrong about what you meant.

| Tag | Route |
|---|---|
| `#principle` `#sin` `#mistake` `#error` `#problem` | principles engine: case → new principle |
| `#data` `#observation` `#reflection` `#idea` `#finding` | compared against the strategy doc; inconsistencies flagged, changes proposed under L-2 |
| `#win` `#wins` `#wygrane` `#liftmeup` | Wins |
| `#add` | add the text that follows to the smart-phrase wall |
| `#edit` | edit the editable fields of the daily card bubble above (§5.1) |
| (none) | capture only, no action, surfaced in a weekly untagged review |

The phrase wall is a retrieval base, not a destination. Every `#` note gets the
single best-fitting phrase from the wall attached to its answer, your own words
returned to you at the moment they apply. `#add` is the only way in.

Two rules on that: a relevance floor (if nothing clears the bar, attach nothing:
a mismatched aphorism on a `#sin` note about addiction is worse than silence),
and no repeat of the same phrase within a rolling window, or the wall collapses
to three favourites.

`#liftmeup` is one word: hashtags break at whitespace, so `#lift me up` would
parse as `#lift` followed by prose.

Discovery: typing `#` alone opens an autocomplete list of the tags. Four aliases
per route are easy to build and impossible to memorise; the picker means the
guide page never has to be load-bearing. `#sin` stays a working alias but is kept
off the public guide list.

Intents, in build order:

1. **capture** — every note lands in `life_notes` regardless of tag. Never fails,
   never blocks.
2. **case (`#mistake`)** — you paste the case and your own reflections. The
   system picks the 👾 category from the fixed six, retrieves which of your
   existing principles bore on it, and proposes the ⚜️ one-liner for approval. It
   does not write the reflection (L-1). Slot 3 stops being a text field and
   becomes retrieval; this is the moment the archive turns into a machine. "I had
   no principles at that time" remains valid, and honest, for anything predating
   the corpus.
3. **goal-diff (`#observation`)** — compares the note against the whole document,
   reports any direct inconsistency ("you noted X; Bet 2 short-term says Y"), and
   proposes an edit with one of your own principles displayed as its warrant and
   an approve button. Subject to the L-2b budget: one per day, the rest queue to
   the weekly review. Never touches the immutable core (L-2a); against that it
   reports, and stops.
4. **conflict** — when a retrieved set contains principles that pull opposite
   ways ("Don't seek validation outside" vs "Seek honest feedback from trusted
   people"), both are shown as a pair for you to weigh. The system never picks
   (L-3). This is what slot 3 asks for.
5. **retire** — a new principle that appears to supersede an old one prompts
   "does this retire #12?". Veto is absolute; on "no", both stay active and the
   question is not re-asked.
6. **board** — "I'm stuck on X" routes to one of the five advisors from Section
   VI (Dalio, Munger, Jobs, John Paul II, Zanussi) by domain and answers in that
   lens. Says which one it picked and why. Holds your own line: none of them
   replaces prayer.
7. **lookup** — "what do I have on money?" retrieves the ~10 relevant
   principles/phrases, never the whole corpus.

**Propose, never commit.** Every derivation lands in a triage state and needs your
approve. A bad prompt day cannot silently corrupt sixty principles earned over
four years.

**Pull, never push (L-4).** The daily card, the comparison flags, and the retire
prompts all wait for you to open the panel. Nothing notifies.

### 5.1 The daily card and #edit

For any user who has completed setup, the daily governance card is generated at
05:00 and waits silently: no notification, no ping. Generation is scheduled;
delivery is not.

`#edit <text>` edits the most recent daily-card bubble, not any bubble above it.
The target is pinned to the card, or the command is refused.

The card's frame is fixed; its content is editable. You cannot edit away the fact
that there is a ONE THING for the day; you can edit what that one thing is, and
say why.

The "why" is the payload: it is captured as a candidate strategy correction, so
tomorrow's card is already right. If it also bears on a longer horizon, that
becomes a normal L-2 proposal: warrant principle displayed, approve button,
inside the daily budget. A `#edit` never silently reaches the 5- or 10-year
document.

## 6. Views (the hamburger)

### 6.1 What shipping publicly costs (L-6)

The Principles tab is public. The corpus in §4 is the evidence for what people
put in a box like this: addiction, marriage doubt, money shame, named third
parties. One founder's corpus in a fenced table is a manageable risk. Every
user's is a data-protection posture.

Required in P1, not P4: the consent screen (page 2 of setup), a retention
statement, a working hard-delete, and self-serve export. This roughly doubles P1
and is not negotiable before the tab is visible to a non-allowlisted user.

Decided (founder, 2026-07-26): no staged rollout. The engine ships public with
the guide, no allowlisted first weeks. So the consent screen, retention
statement, hard-delete and export are launch blockers, not follow-ups, and the
copy has no soft-launch in which to be tested.

### 6.2 The Principles tab is state-dependent

Three jobs, never on one page:

- **First visit** — page 1: what principles and `#` are, one page of text. Page 2:
  consent.
- **Setup (once)** — a Typeform-style flow, same pattern as speaking-project
  onboarding: daily / weekly / monthly / quarterly / yearly / 5y / 10y / 20y
  goals with dates, quantities, SMART fields. GPT then generates the document
  set. Editable forever after; downloadable as one document and re-uploadable.
- **Every visit after** — results: derived principles on top (click through to
  the full case and reasoning), the downloadable strategy document below.

Setup is a hard gate (founder, 2026-07-26). No progressive path: a `#` typed by a
user who hasn't completed setup does not run the engine. It returns a short
redirect to the Principles tab. Rejected alternative: engine-first, setup-later.

Three mechanics this makes load-bearing:

- The typed note is kept, not dropped. It lands in `life_notes` and is replayed
  through the engine the moment setup completes. Someone who reaches for
  `#mistake` is holding a thought they wanted recorded; losing it to a redirect
  teaches them the tag costs something.
- Save-and-resume on the form. Eight horizons is long enough that people will be
  interrupted partway. Without resume, an interruption is an abandonment, and the
  gate has no second door.
- The redirect line is product copy on a live surface → founder sign-off before
  it ships.

Consequence, stated once: the form is now the only entrance to the feature, so
its completion rate is the feature's adoption rate.

Word round-trip: re-upload produces a diff you approve, never a silent overwrite.
Arbitrary Word formatting reconciled back into structured sections will not
round-trip cleanly, so the diff is the safety net. Markdown or an in-app editor
would be safer if you'll accept it.

### 6.3 The menu

| Entry | Source | Port cost |
|---|---|---|
| Principles | `life_cases` + principle items | UI exists (Next.js pages), swap localStorage for API |
| Wins | win items | UI exists |
| Phrases | phrase items | new, trivial list |
| Today | `life_days` + habits + one_thing | new, the daily card |
| Goals | bets → goals, ranked | new |
| Timeline | event items + goals with `due_at` | ported and re-skinned to app design (§3.6) |
| Distractions | distraction items | new, trivial |
| Strategy | `life_strategy` current version | new: read + edit + download/upload |
| Prayer | link out to pompeiana.willpowerlab.com (§3.4) | no port; coach-only for now |

The timeline is where goals become visible against the calendar: `[Aug]` goals
render as markers, bets as colour bands (🟢🔵🟣 already match the canvas's
`categoryColor` field).

## 7. Phasing

| Phase | Content | Exit condition |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | Inventory ✅ · exports taken · taxonomy frozen · strategy doc transcribed | three JSON files exist on disk |
| P1 | BE: tables + RLS + `/v2/life/*` + allowlist + export/delete. Importers. | corpus is in Supabase, verified row-count and spot-check against the exports |
| P2 | FE: `/panel` shell + hamburger + port principles/wins/timeline. Pompeiana linked. | you use the panel instead of the old apps for a week |
| P3 | Chat: capture → case walker → daily card → goal diffs. Strategy doc as router context. | a case typed in chat becomes an approved principle |
| P4 | Board · phrases · distractions · weekly review · (optional) pompeiana counter sync | weekly review runs in-app on a Sunday |

P1 before P2 deliberately: the data moves first. If the shell slips, the corpus is
already safe and RLS-protected. The reverse order gives you a nice shell over
four silos, which is where you are now.

Nothing is cut over big-bang. The old apps stay deployed and untouched until the
matching view exists and you have used it.

## 8. Open questions

1. `mvp.willpowerlab.com` alias. Want it, or is `/panel` enough? It is ~10 lines
   of hostname routing and zero code fork. Only reason to want it: your daily
   landing page.
2. Spendings app. Mentioned in the first message, never since, no path given. In
   or out of P1? Out is the cleaner default; the money shape is the one that
   doesn't fit `life_items`.
3. Bet 3 in the daily card. The daily shows 🟣 DREAM items, but the weekly says
   the dream "does not drive daily execution". Should the router be allowed to
   propose a daily task against Bet 3, or is it display-only?
4. Case dating. Most cases have no date; a few do ("03/01/2026"). Import puts
   undated cases at their `createdAt`. Acceptable, or do you want an undated
   bucket?
5. Category proposal. Locked at six. Confirm GPT may suggest a seventh for your
   approval, or should the list be closed entirely?

## 9. Migrations to run (when P1 lands)

Single file for the Supabase SQL Editor, idempotent (`IF NOT EXISTS`), RLS in the
same file:

```
add_life_panel.sql   life_notes · life_cases · life_items · life_strategy
                     · life_days · life_weeks + RLS policies + indexes
```

Env to set: `LIFE_PANEL_ENABLED=0` (flip after FE deploy) ·
`LIFE_PANEL_ALLOWLIST=<user_id>`.
