# Frontend Cursor prompt: willab bugfixes (production-ready)

You are a senior frontend engineer working on **willab** (willpower lab), the speech coaching app: Next.js frontend with BFF (API routes proxy to Flask backend). The app runs a **5-step homework flow** for students: warm-up recording → metric questions → final recording → post-questions → report. Your task is to support **five backend bugfixes** and implement the **admin + student UI for the video feature** without breaking the flow or the existing API contract.

---

## Architecture context

- **BFF:** Next.js API routes under `src/app/api/homework/*` and `src/app/api/admin/*` proxy to the backend (`/v2/homework/*`, `/v2/admin/*`). Preserve request/response shapes; do not strip `status` or rename fields (e.g. `report_text`).
- **Student flow:** `HomeworkFlowCard.tsx` (or equivalent) drives steps 0–5. **Single source of truth:** top-level `status` from backend. Use `applyStatusToState(res)` after every mutation and on cold load; never downgrade step. See `docs/HOMEWORK-AND-PERFORMANCE.md` (in the backend repo or copied) for the full frontend contract.
- **Admin:** Admin pages and API client for students, tasks, warm-ups, post-questions, speaker profile, and **send assignment**. Reference: `docs/frontend-admin-panel/` in the backend repo.
- **Key contracts:** Status values `none` | `recording_1_required` | `task_block` | `final_task_ready` | `post_questions` | `completed`. Step = map from status only. Report data comes from POST post-answers response (`report_text`, `performance_score_end`) and/or GET session when available.

---

## Issues and your role

### 1. Performance score 2 always shows 30% (backend fix; frontend verify)

**Backend:** Fixes the scoring logic so `performance_score_2` is no longer hardcoded to 30%.

**Your role:**

- Ensure the **report step (step 5)** and any **dashboard/history** views that show `performance_score_2` or `performance_score_end` use the values returned by the API (e.g. from POST post-answers or GET session). No client-side override or default to 30%.
- After the backend fix, verify that after a full flow the displayed score matches the backend response (e.g. check Network tab: POST post-answers response body).

---

### 2. Report description only filler count + time in range (backend fix; frontend display)

**Backend:** Changes the report generation so the text contains only filler count and time in good range (or "not yet tracked").

**Your role:**

- The report is still shown from the same field: **`report_text`** (from POST post-answers response, or from session when loading a completed session). No API contract change.
- Ensure the **report UI** (step 5) renders `report_text` as the main description. If you currently truncate or reshape it, stop; show the backend string as-is so the new concise format is visible.
- Optional: if you have a separate "metrics" or "stats" block, you can keep it; the main report copy should be the new short backend text.

---

### 3. Where "context" is stored/used (backend doc; frontend awareness)

**Backend:** Adds `docs/CONTEXT-FIELDS.md` (or equivalent) describing `context_short`, `context_long`, `coach_notes`.

**Your role:**

- **Do not** send "context" to the backend in places the API doesn't expect (e.g. do not add a new "context" field to requests unless the backend adds it).
- On the **report screen**, the text you show is `report_text` (backend's `context_long` content). Admin views may show session detail including the same report text. No frontend change required unless you were misusing a context field; if so, align with the backend doc.

---

### 4. Homework email design (backend fix)

**Backend:** Improves the HTML and layout of the assignment email sent by POST send-assignment.

**Your role:** None. Email is sent server-side. Optionally, after the backend change, trigger a test send from the admin "Send assignment" button and confirm the received email looks correct.

---

### 5. Admin video upload/URL + student video (full-stack; frontend implementation)

**Backend (done by backend team):** Adds `tutor_video_url` to session; send-assignment accepts optional `video_url`; GET session/status returns `tutor_video_url` when set.

**Your role: implement the UI.**

#### 5a. Admin: send assignment with video URL

- **Place:** On the same screen/modal where the admin clicks "Send assignment" (e.g. student detail or homework config).
- **UI:** Add an optional field: "Video URL (optional)" — text input where the admin can paste a link (e.g. Loom, YouTube, Supabase Storage). Optional: "Upload video" that uploads to your storage and then pastes the resulting URL into this field (if backend adds an upload endpoint later, you can call it and set the field).
- **API:** When the user clicks "Send assignment", call **POST /api/admin/students/[id]/send-assignment** with a body if the backend supports it, e.g. `{ "video_url": "<value from input>" }`. If the backend only adds `video_url` as an optional body field, send it when the field is non-empty. Do not change the existing behavior when the field is empty (same request as today).
- **BFF:** Ensure the route that proxies to **POST /v2/admin/students/<id>/send-assignment** forwards the request body (including optional `video_url`) to the backend.

#### 5b. Student: show video on homework page

- **When:** When the student is on the homework flow and the current session has a tutor video (e.g. `session.tutor_video_url` or the value returned in GET session/status in the session object).
- **Where:** Show the video in a sensible place: e.g. on **step 0** (no active session but show "Your coach left you a message" with the video), or at the top of the flow when there is an active session with `tutor_video_url`, or on **step 5** (report) as "Coach's message". Align with product: one clear place so the student sees it once per assignment.
- **How:** If the URL is to a public page (e.g. Loom, YouTube), you can use an iframe or a link "Watch video" that opens in a new tab. If it's a direct video file URL, use a `<video>` tag or a link to open/download. Prefer a simple link/button if the URL might be any of these.
- **Data:** GET session/status returns the session object; ensure your type and state include `tutor_video_url` (optional string). When you have an active session (or the session object from status), read `session.tutor_video_url` and render the video block only when it's non-empty.

**Acceptance:**

- Admin can paste a video URL and send assignment; the request includes `video_url` when provided.
- Student receives the email (with video link) and, after starting homework, sees the tutor video on the homework page when the backend returns `tutor_video_url`.

## Testing checklist

- [ ] **Score 2:** After backend fix, run a full flow and confirm the score shown on the report step matches the API (no 30% stuck).
- [ ] **Report:** After backend fix, confirm the report step shows the new short text (filler count + time in range or "not yet tracked").
- [ ] **Context:** No unintended "context" usage on the frontend; report screen shows `report_text` only.
- [ ] **Email:** No frontend change; optional: trigger send and check inbox.
- [ ] **Video:** Admin can enter video URL and send assignment; student sees the video on the homework page when `tutor_video_url` is present in the session.

**Critical:** Do not change the homework flow (steps 0–5, status-driven, applyStatusToState). Do not remove or rename API calls (e.g. keep using `report_text`). Add the video field and UI only where described; keep the rest of the contract unchanged.
